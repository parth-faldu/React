# ToDo List

ToDo List is a task management application built with React, Vite, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, with all data stored locally using localStorage for persistence. The app provides a simple and efficient way to keep track of daily tasks with a fast and responsive interface.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
